                                Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
                                The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
                                Or to take arms against a sea of troubles
                                And by opposing end them?

                                To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub;
                                For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
                                When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
